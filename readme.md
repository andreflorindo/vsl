# VSL Deposition Motion planning
This is a experimental motion planning for VSL deposition using Moveit! (STILL IN WORK).

Some industrial task, such as welding and composite deposition, require the end-effector to follow a predefined cartesian path. Ideally, a constant end-effector velocity would improve the quality of the process.

It will be analysed the behavior of a KUKA Industrial Manipulator for different motion planner such as OMPL, Descartes, STOMP and TrajOpt.
